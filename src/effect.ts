/**
 * Registers a reactive side effect that is executed whenever any signals accessed
 * within the `callback` are updated. If the `callback` returns a cleanup function,
 * it will be called before the next effect execution and when the effect is disposed.
 *
 * Caution: Mutating a signal within its own effect may produce an infinite loop.
 * See the README for details.
 *
 * @example
 * import { effect, Signal } from 'signal.js';
 *
 * const counter = new Signal.State(0);
 * const isEven = new Signal.Computed(() => (counter.get() & 1) === 0);
 * const parity = new Signal.Computed(() => (isEven.get() ? "even" : "odd"));
 *
 * // Logs "even" immediately, then on every counter change
 * const dispose = effect(() => {
 *   console.log(parity.get());
 * });
 *
 * setInterval(() => counter.set(counter.get() + 1), 1000);
 *
 * // To clean up:
 * // dispose();
 *
 * @param {EffectCallback} callback - Function executed when dependent signals change.
 * If it returns a function, that function is used as a cleanup and called
 * before the next invocation or disposal.
 *
 * @returns {() => void} Dispose function: when called, stops effect reactions
 * and invokes any registered cleanup
